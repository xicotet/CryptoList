This project was part of the initial step when joining Rudo Apps company.
The main purpose was to assess the initial skills of the newby programmers in Android's department (aka Academy in Rudo's jargon). Android mentor's wanted to know wheter internship students have knowledge on connecting to an
API using, for example, Retrofit library. They also asked us if we were able of displaying the retrieved cryptocurrencies data in sort of a list, preferably using RecyclerView.

Some extra features and functionality, despite not being fully implemented here, were desirable (i.e.
being capable of favoriting and deleting coins, using some design architecture like MVVM, etc.)
